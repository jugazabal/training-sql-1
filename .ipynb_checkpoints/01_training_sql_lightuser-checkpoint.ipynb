    "# Training: SQL (Light-users) üë©‚Äçüíª\n",
    "Welcome to the training notebook on using SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is pitched at light-users who perform basic querying operations to retrieve lightly-wrangled data from SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "They will have **READ-ONLY** or higher access to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is SQL? üóÉ\n",
    "SQL stands for *structured-query-language* and amongst bedroom geeks like myself, is commonly referred to verbally as *'sequel'*, a shorthand for S-Q-L. (Two syllables instead of three). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is mainly used for the following cases:\n",
    "- Effectively storing data (especially at a larger scale)\n",
    "- Efficiently reshaping large-scale data in a format suitable for analysis\n",
    "- Rapidly performing simple computations of large-scale data\n",
    "    + Such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not so good for:\n",
    "- Customising the formatting of table outputs (use thangs like Excel or R for that) \n",
    "- Creating plots (use thangs like Excel or R for that)\n",
    "- Writing reports (use thangs like Word or R for that)\n",
    "- Nicely drawing maps (use thangs like R for that)\n",
    "    + Technically, can have maps displayed in SQL but they can look basic\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note when we say \"large-scale data\", we mean data that exceeds the amount of in-memory/RAM the computer in which you are doing your analysis has.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** - SQL is not case sensitive\n",

    "Whereas this training session is being delivered in a **Azure Data Studio** notebook, it is recommended that you do most of your SQL-related work in Microsoft's **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because SSMS offers a better graphical user interface (GUI) to enable you to easily explore databses, tables, Views, stored procedures etc. whereas Azure Data Studio does not have the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SSMS, you can visually navigate around the Server; by expanding sub folders in the Object Explorer pane you can explore the databases you have access to. You can right click on the objects to perform particular actions, such as generating code to preview a table or viewing table properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following details will need to be entered to access the data:\n",
    "- Server: **<*your_sql_server_name*>**\n",

    "\n",
    "## What will this session cover? üëÅ\n",
    "This session will show you how to do the following things in SQL:\n",
    "1. Basic relational database theory\n",
    "1. Basic query to retrieve all records from a table - `SELECT...`\n",
    "1. Choosing unique entries in a column - `DISTINCT`\n",
    "1. Filtering data from a table - `WHERE...`\n",
    "1. Sorting/Arranging/Ordering data from a table - `ORDER BY...`\n",
    "1. Grouping your data to aggregate it - `...<aggregatation_function> ... GROUP BY...`\n",
    "1. Joining data from different tables next to each other - `<join_type>...ON...` \n",
    "1. Attaching data from similarly structured tables on top of each other - `...UNION...`\n",
    "1. Creating new columns in your data - `...[<created_column_name>]`\n",
    "1. Changing columns to a different data type - `CAST([<column_name> AS <data_type>])...` \n",
    "1. Using conditional if-else statements - `CASE WHEN [<column_name>] = x THEN y...ELSE *<value_to_change_to> END...`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic relational database theory and T-SQL üß†\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases are the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database is a collective set of multiple data sets organised by tables, records and columns. RDBs establish a well-defined relationship between database tables. Tables communicate and share information, which facilitates data search-ability, organisation and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A core concept of relational databases is **reducing redundancy in data**. This means that it is aimed that data is stored once and only once. If data is redundant you risk the chance of contradiction which reduces data integrity. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:** There are multiple different spellings of Local Authority names across the Department. A database should aim to have one table linking LA Numbers to LA Names and then use LA Numbers in any other related data sets. This should be applied accross all tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tables** üõè\n",
    "\n",
    "In SSMS, within the tables folder you will find all the raw data that is stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further expand the tables with the + symbol to take a look at its columns, keys etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Columns are assigned a data type that they can not violate and if they are allowed to be blank or not. Most commonly used data types are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- nvarchar/varchar - store text of different types\n",
    "- int - Integers (whole numbers)\n",
    "- decimal - for decimals of a specified precision\n",
    "- float - Floating point numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table should have a *Primary Key* that all other fields in the table are related to. If this is set for a table then it will be viewable under the *Keys* section under tables. üóù\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schemas** üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects within a database can be grouped together into different Schema. \n",
    "\n",
    "Permissions on tables are generally inherited from permissions on the schemas, i.e. if you have permission to use a schema, you have permissions to use all the tables within it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transact-SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is the language we use to retrieve data from Microsoft SQL Databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines the basic commands associated with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** T-SQL is Microsoft specific and other variations of SQL will not always work on Microsoft SQL Databases due to differences in syntaxes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important as if you are searching for solutions to common SQL problems online it will need to be a T-SQL solution to work with Microsoft databases.\n"

    "\n",
    "> **TIP FOR FORMATTING:** Putting the comma on a new line in front of the [column_name] allows you to quickly comment out columns you don't want to view.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **TIP FOR COMMENTING CODE:** Inserting `--` in front of code comments it out. The hot-key for commenting out a line or bulk selection in SQL is typically `Ctrl-K` then `Ctrl-C`. To uncomment, do `Ctrl-K` then `Ctrl-U`.\n",
