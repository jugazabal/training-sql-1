/* Training: SQL - Exercises */
-- DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this script is to provide exercises for the trainee to practice what 
--				was covered in the accompanying `training_sql_heavyuser.ipynb` notebook.

USE [AdventureWorks];

/* Question 1: Dynamic SQL querying #1 */
-- Q.			Is there an even more efficient way to perform the same task as in the query below
--				without having to use dynamic SQL querying?
-- Hint:		Consider using System Talbes belong to the [INFORMATION_SCHEMA] database.
-- Note:		This exercise introduces you to some very useful tables that exist in the background which 
--				will be extremely useful for data management tasks. It also shows that dynamic SQL is not always the best option.

-- A.			Please write your answer below.
SELECT
	[SchemaName] = SCHEMA_NAME(table_object.[schema_id])
	,[TableName] = table_object.[Name] 
	,[RowCount] = AVG(table_partition.[rows])
FROM [sys].[objects] AS table_object
INNER JOIN [sys].[partitions] table_partition
	ON table_object.[object_id] = table_partition.[object_id]
WHERE table_object.[type] = 'U'
GROUP BY
	table_object.[schema_id]
	,table_object.[Name];


/* Question 2: Inserting data into tables */
-- Q.			The [Person].[ProductPreference] table has been created for you to work with.
--				Can you complte one row of this table with your preferences?
CREATE TABLE [Person].[ProductPreference]
(
   [StaffId] INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY
   ,[StaffUnit] NVARCHAR(25)
   ,[BookFavourite] NVARCHAR(100)
   ,[BookAuthor] NVARCHAR(100)
   ,[SongFavourite] NVARCHAR(100)
   ,[SongArtist] NVARCHAR(100)
   ,[FilmFavourite] NVARCHAR(100)
   ,[FilmDirector] NVARCHAR(100)
   ,[DateTimeCreation] DATETIME DEFAULT(GETDATE()) 
);
-- Note:		From the definitions of the [StaffId] and [DateTimeCreation] fields, 
--				there is no need for you to enter these yourselves. Do you know what they do?
-- A.			Please write your answer below.
INSERT INTO [Person].[ProductPreference]
(
	[StaffUnit]
	,[BookFavourite]
	,[BookAuthor]
	,[SongFavourite]
	,[SongArtist]
	,[FilmFavourite]
	,[FilmDirector]
)
VALUES
('Statistics', 'Half a Lifelong Romance', 'Eileen Chang', 'Night Dream', 'LEEBADA', 'The Handmaiden', 'Park Chan-wook');
--				[StaffId] counts the row entry that the record sits in.
--				[DataTimeCreation] records the data and time the record was created.

/* Question 3: Thinking about objects in SQL */
-- Q.			Consider the following discussion questions below:
--				 1. Thinking about the [StaffId] column, do you know what it does?
--				 2. Why might the name of this column be inappropriate for what it actually does?
--				 3. Can you think of a way to improve this?
-- A.			Please write your answer below.
--				1. Is a row counter.
--				2. The same member of staff should get the same [StaffId] entry but will get different ones
--					when they enter two rows of data.
--				3. Rename the [StaffId] column to [RowId] or something similar. Have an
--					extra column that identifies unique SQL user.
--				Addedum: This is not a well-governed table as a consequence of this.


/* Question 4: Dynamic unpivoting*/
--				In actual fact, the table created above, [Person].[ProductPreference] is not in a tidy data form. 
--				As a database manager, this is a personal affront to you as you want to provide analysts with a 
--				formatted table of data that makes their jobs easier.
-- Q.			Can you unpivot the [Person].[ProductPreference] table so that it is in tidy data format? 
--				Try to unpivot it without explicitly referncing the columns you want to unpivot to rows.
-- Note:		This exercise is designed to get you thinking about what makes a good, structured table in SQL 
--				that's helpful to the end-user, the analyst. It brings in concepts covered in (1.) and (2.).

-- A.			Please write your answer below.
--				Addedum: This is not a well-governed table because the database is meant to be
--						 providing nicely formatted data for analysts and this table is not in tidy format.
-- declare variables to use in dynamic sql
DECLARE @cols AS NVARCHAR(MAX), @query  AS NVARCHAR(MAX);
DECLARE @name_schema AS NVARCHAR(25) = 'Person';
DECLARE @name_table AS NVARCHAR(50) = 'ProductPreference';

DECLARE @columns_keep AS NVARCHAR(255) = 'StaffId,StaffUnit';
DECLARE @column_measure AS NVARCHAR(15) = 'MediaType';
DECLARE @column_value AS NVARCHAR(15) = 'MediaSelection';

-- store list of all columns
SET @cols = 
(
	SELECT STRING_AGG([COLUMN_NAME],',') 
	FROM (
		SELECT DISTINCT [COLUMN_NAME] 
		FROM [INFORMATION_SCHEMA].[COLUMNS]
		WHERE [TABLE_NAME] = @name_table
			-- cheated a bit here as this is causing issue
			AND [COLUMN_NAME] NOT IN ('DataTimeCreation')
	) AS t
);

-- remove columns we don't want to unpivot from list of variables
SET @cols = REPLACE(@cols, ',' + @columns_keep, '');

-- dynamic SQL unpivot
set @query = 
'
	SELECT ' + @columns_keep + ',' + @column_measure + ', ' + @column_value + ' 
	FROM
    (
		SELECT *
		FROM [' + @name_schema + '].[' + @name_table + ']
	) AS x
	UNPIVOT
    (' +
		@column_value + '
        FOR ' + @column_measure + ' IN (' + @cols + ')
    ) AS p 
';

-- see dynamic SQL query generated
PRINT @query;

-- execute dynamic SQL query
EXEC sp_executesql @query;


/* Question 5: Adding contraint to prevent rogue entries */
-- Q.			In the [Person].[ProductPreference] table, can you add a constraint on 
--				the [FilmFavourite] column to ensure that is must always be completed?
-- A.			Please write your answer below.
ALTER TABLE [Person].[ProductPreference]
ALTER COLUMN [FilmFavourite] NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;


/* Question 6: Stored procedures and functions */
-- Q.			From running the stored procedure and function defined above, 
--				what is the difference in how they are prompted to run?
-- A.			Please write your answer below.
--				Stored procedure is run in its entirety, with an `EXEC <stored_proc_name>`
--				whereas function is run within a `SELECT ...` statement. This leads to differences
--				in how they are used.


/* Question 7: Querying from a big-brother table */
-- Q.			In the [AuditDetails].[vw_DatabaseChangeLog] table, can you query it 
--				to look for changes that you have done to the database?
-- A.			Please write your answer below.
SELECT *
FROM [AuditDetails].[vw_DatabaseChangeLog]
WHERE [NameUser] LIKE '%Ho%';
